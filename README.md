### Understand the project in short
This is a Quiz app built with React and Vite, which uses JSON server as mock API to simulate an API response from where you can fetch data for questions and options. The frontend is built using functional components in React and Redux for managing global state. It has three pages: Home page (where user starts), Quiz Page (user takes the test) and Answers Page (where users submit their answer). There are also CSS files for styling purposes. The `db.json` file contains all the question data that will be served by the mock
API when requested.
